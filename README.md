# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# Overview of Project
Pewlett-Hackard is expecting a large number of employees to begin retiring. In order to prepare for this wave of retirees and potential job openings, the team was tasked with analyzing the existing employee and department data to find the full scope of the "silver tsunami". The analysis also covers the potenial for a "mentorship" program, in which employees of a certain age could stay on part time in a mentorship capacity.

# Results

The table below shows the impact of the upcoming retirements by job title. It is mainly senior staff positions that will be affected, which could open up advancement oppurtunities for current employees. It could also be anb oppurtunity to create a senior mentorship position to fill some of the opening in a part itme capacity for potential retirees to stay on as mentors to the junior associates, as well as to provide mentoring to newly promoted employees.

In the case of the proposed mentorship program, the table below shows a list of employees who would be eligible to participate if they wished. There over 1500 employees who would meet the criteria that was given for this positiion, indicating that this could be a good oppurtunity to offer this mentroship program, as there is not a lack of candidates.

# Summary 
With the amount of employees who are reaching retirement age, Pewlett-Hackard will need to prepare for an extensive process over the next few years. The analysis has been broken down by the number of retirees for each department in addition to by job title. The table below shows these counts by department.

With the number of retirees who are also eligible for the mentorship program, it could be in the best interest of Pewlett-Hackard to pursue this project. This would keep a few positions filled at least part time, and create a valuable resourse for new and existing employees.
